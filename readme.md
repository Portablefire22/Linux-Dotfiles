I am probably missing a few things

# Sway 

Created with only dual monitors in mind, display variables will need to be modified in sway/config.

# Waybar 

Waybar assumes the interface is "enp14s0"

# Pywal 

`wal -i "<wallpaper path>"`

## Pywalfox 

Pywalfox requires an addon for usage. Installation instructions on the pywalfox github listed in Prerequisites.
